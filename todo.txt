move data, settings into app
ux: properties for range of cells
ux: set reference cell by clicking
refresh: how?
cell width depends on stripes vs text
where does the data belong? (app, table, ...?  app.settings, app.data, ...)
table seems to manage it pretty well.  should it be state?
simple react dialog
how to invoke it?

Handsontable.setCellMeta(row, col, 'class', 'value')

table.setCellMeta(row, col, 'drawStripes', true)

how to get reference to the hot from react?

cell-indexed map of data instead of 2D array? >> looks like not.


model: store property how? redux?
  redux: use afterchange hook to update the store state.
